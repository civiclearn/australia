  <h2>Why Australian values matter</h2>
  <p>
    Australian citizenship is not only about living in Australia. It also means
    understanding and respecting the <strong>values and democratic beliefs</strong>
    that underpin Australian society.
  </p>
  <p>
    These values are shared by people from many cultural backgrounds and are
    protected by Australia’s laws and democratic institutions.
    You are tested on them because they guide how Australians live together.
  </p>

  <h2>Freedom and respect for the individual</h2>
  <p>
    Australians believe in <strong>freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of association</strong>.
    People are free to express their opinions, practise their religion, or choose not to follow a religion at all,
    as long as they obey the law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Respect for the dignity and worth of each individual is central.
    Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation is not acceptable.
  </p>

  <h2>Equality and a fair go</h2>
  <p>
    Equality before the law is a fundamental Australian value.
    This means that everyone is subject to the same laws and has the same legal rights and responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea of a <strong>“fair go”</strong> reflects the belief that people should have the opportunity to succeed
    through hard work, without unfair barriers.
  </p>

  <h2>The rule of law</h2>
  <p>
    In Australia, the law applies to everyone, including government officials and political leaders.
    No one is above the law.
  </p>
  <p>
    An independent judiciary ensures that laws are applied fairly
    and that people are treated equally in courts.
  </p>

  <h2>Democracy and civic participation</h2>
  <p>
    Australia is a democratic country where citizens elect representatives to parliament.
    Voting in federal and state elections is <strong>both a right and a responsibility</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Australians are encouraged to participate in civic life,
    express their views peacefully and contribute to their community.
  </p>

  <h2>Responsibilities of Australian citizens</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>obeying the law</li>
    <li>voting in elections and referendums</li>
    <li>serving on a jury if required</li>
    <li>defending Australia if the need arises</li>
    <li>respecting the rights and freedoms of others</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What you must know for the test</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>the meaning of freedom and equality in Australia</li>
    <li>what the rule of law means</li>
    <li>why respect and tolerance are important</li>
    <li>the rights and responsibilities of citizens</li>
    <li>how democracy works in practice</li>
  </ul>
